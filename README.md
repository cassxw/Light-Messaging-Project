# 💡 Light-Based Messaging with STM Development Boards

## 🚀 Overview

This project explores an innovative approach to data communication using **light signals**. By leveraging **STM development boards**, we demonstrate a seamless **embedded system-to-embedded system** messaging system. The core objective is to transmit **analog data** - specifically, readings from an onboard potentiometer (POT) sampled via an **ADC**—from a **Transmitter (Sensor Node - SN)** to a **Receiver (Central Node - CN)**.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **🔘 Push-button-triggered data sampling**
- **📡 GPIO-based data transmission** using the ‘Bit-Bang’ method
- **💡 Custom Light-of-Things (LoT) Message Protocol** with parity checks
- **⚡ Real-time error detection and correction mechanisms**
- **👂 Continuous listening mode at the receiver** for improved responsiveness
- **📟 LCD display for real-time decoded data output**

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system consists of:

- **📤 Transmitter (Sensor Node - SN)**
  - Equipped with an **ADC** to sample an onboard **POT**
  - Transmits the sampled data as a **binary message** using **light pulses** (LED)
  - Implements the **LoT Message Protocol** for structured message transmission
  - Includes a **checkpoint mechanism** to track transmitted samples

- **📥 Receiver (Central Node - CN)**
  - Continuously listens for incoming **light-based binary messages**
  - Decodes the received data and displays it on an **LCD**
  - Implements **error detection** via **parity checks**
  - Compares received samples with checkpoint messages to ensure data integrity

## 📜 Light-of-Things (LoT) Message Protocol

The LoT protocol defines two types of messages:

### 📡 **1. Data Message**

Transmits sampled ADC values from the Transmitter to the Receiver.

- **🟢 Start-of-Text (SOT) [1-bit]** - LED ON for 1s
- **🔵 Message Identifier [1-bit]** - LED OFF for 1s (Data Message)
- **📊 Data Packet [16-bit]** - Represents ADC value; LED ON (1) / OFF (0) for 500ms
- **✅ Even Parity Bit [1-bit]** - Used for error detection
- **🔴 End-of-Text (EOT) [1-bit]** - LED blinks rapidly for 1s

### 🔍 **2. Checkpoint Message**

Ensures message reliability by tracking sent/received samples.

- **🟢 Start-of-Text (SOT) [1-bit]** - LED ON for 1s
- **🟡 Message Identifier [1-bit]** - LED ON for 1s (Checkpoint Message)
- **📈 Checkpoint Packet [16-bit]** - Represents sample count
- **✅ Even Parity Bit [1-bit]** - Ensures data integrity
- **🔴 End-of-Text (EOT) [1-bit]** - LED blinks rapidly for 1s

## ⚠️ Error Detection & Handling

1. **✅ Parity Bit Check** - Detects single-bit errors within data packets
2. **📊 Checkpoint Message Verification** - Compares expected vs. received samples
   - If **mismatch** → LED blinks rapidly for 2s (🚨 Error Alert)
   - If **match** → LED remains ON for 2s (✅ Success)

## 🎨 Design Choices & Modifications

- **🖧 GPIO ‘Bit-Bang’ Method:** Direct GPIO manipulation for **binary serial transmission** over light signals.
- **🔄 Continuous Listening Mode:** The Receiver remains in an **always-on** state for dynamic responsiveness.
- **✅ Parity Bit Addition:** Enhances error detection beyond just missing messages.
- **📟 LCD Display Output:** Provides real-time data visualisation.
